R scripts for analysis of Musca immunity
==

These are the R scripts and raw data associated with the manuscript Sackton et al ()....

To replicate our analysis:

1. Load data and run the differential expression analysis with DESeq2 by running the load_data.R script (which calls difexp.R)

2. Run analysis scripts:
  - GOanalysis.R runs the analysis of GO terms, using blast2go data for M. domestica from the genome paper.
  - strata_analysis.R runs the phylostratigraphic analysis.
